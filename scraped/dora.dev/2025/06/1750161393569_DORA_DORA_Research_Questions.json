To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statement: For my current role, I am embedded on the team I work with. Documentationlink click to copy link Think about the documentation you use. We define documentation as internal documentation for the services or applications you work on (for example, manuals, readmes, code comments, etc.). End-users are not the audience for these documents. Please rate how strongly you agree or disagree with the following statements. I can rely on our technical documentation when I need to use or work with the services or applications I work on It is easy to find the right technical document when I need to understand something about the services or applications I work on Technical documentation is updated as changes are made When there's an incident or problem that needs troubleshooting, I reach for the documentation Flexible Infrastructurelink click to copy link Think about the infrastructure or platform where the primary application or service you work on runs. Please rate how strongly you agree or disagree with the following statements Computing resources are pooled and shared by multiple applications with resources and capabilities dynamically assigned and re-assigned based on demand. I can access and modify resources (compute, storage, etc.) and capabilities (APIs, monitoring, etc.) from a broad range of devices (for example smartphones, tablets, laptops) over the network without the need for proprietary plug-ins or protocols. I can dynamically increase or decrease the resources available for the service or product that I primarily support on demand. I can monitor or control the quantity and/or cost of resources used by the service or product that I primarily support. Once I have access, I can independently provision and configure resources (compute, storage, etc.) and capabilities (APIs, monitoring, etc.) on demand, without raising tickets or requiring human interaction.
