  "title": "DORA | Capabilities",
  "content": "Capability catalog Explore the practices and capabilities that foster a learning environment, efficient processes, and rapid feedback, all of which accelerate software delivery and enhance overall organizational performance. Each of these articles presentes specific practices, providing implementation guidance and strategies to overcome common challenges. You can also learn how to deploy a program to implement these capabilities in our guide “How to Transform.” Code maintainability core Make it easy for developers to find, reuse, and change code, and keep dependencies up-to-date. Learn more Documentation quality core Maintain accurate, well-organized, user-centric internal documentation to empower teams throughout the software development process. Learn more Empowering teams to choose tools core Empower teams to make informed decisions on tools and technologies. Learn how these decisions drive more effective software delivery. Learn more Generative organizational culture core Discover how growing a generative, high-trust culture drives better organizational and software delivery performance. Learn more Job satisfaction core Find out about the importance of ensuring your people have the tools and resources to do their job, and of making good use of their skills and abilities. Learn more Learning culture Grow a learning culture and understand its impact on your organizational performance. Learn more Team experimentation Innovate faster by building empowered teams that can try out new ideas without approval from people outside the team. Learn more Transformational leadership Learn how effective leaders influence software delivery performance by driving the adoption of technical and product management capabilities. Learn more Well-being core A focus on employee happiness and work environment can improve organizational performance while helping retain talent. Learn more Continuous delivery core Make deploying software a reliable, low-risk process that can be performed on demand at any time. Learn more Database change management core Make sure database changes don't cause problems or slow you down. Learn more Deployment automation core Best practices and approaches for deployment automation and reducing manual intervention in the release process. Learn more Flexible infrastructure core Find out how to manage cloud infrastructure effectively so you can achieve higher levels of agility, availability, and cost visibility. Learn more Loosely coupled teams core Learn about moving from a tightly coupled architecture to service-oriented and microservice architectures without re-architecting everything at once Learn more Streamlining change approval core Replace heavyweight change-approval processes with peer review, to get the benefits of a more reliable, compliant release process without sacrificing speed. Learn more Trunk-based development Prevent merge-conflict hassles with trunk-based development practices. Learn more Version control core A guide to implementing the right version control practices for reproducibility and traceability. Learn more Visual management Learn about the principles of visual management to promote information sharing, get a common understanding of where the team is, and how to improve. Learn more Work in process limits Prioritize work, limit the amount of things that people are working on, and focus on getting a small number of high-priority tasks done. Learn more Working in small batches core Create shorter lead times and faster feedback loops by working in small batches. Learn common obstacles to this critical capability and how to overcome them. Learn more Continuous integration core Learn about common mistakes, ways to measure, and how to improve on your continuous integration efforts. Learn more Customer feedback Drive better organizational outcomes by gathering customer feedback and incorporating it into product and feature design. Learn more Monitoring and observability core Learn how to build tooling to help you understand and debug your production systems. Learn more Monitoring systems to inform business decisions Improve monitoring across infrastructure platforms, middleware, and the application tier, so you can provide fast feedback to developers. Learn more Pervasive security core Build security into the software development lifecycle without compromising delivery speed. Learn more Proactive failure notification Set proactive failure notifications to identify critical issues and act on problems before they arise. Learn more Test automation core Improve software quality by building reliable automated test suites and performing all kinds of testing throughout the software delivery lifecycle. Learn more Test data management core Understand the right strategies for managing test data effectively along with approaches to provide fast, secure data access for testing. Learn more Visibility of work in the value stream Understand and visualize the flow of work from idea to customer outcome in order to drive higher performance. Learn more",
