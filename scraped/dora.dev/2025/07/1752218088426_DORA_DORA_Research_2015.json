  "content": "Prior to 2018, research was conducted in partnership with Puppet, as an extension of their original State of DevOps research. Read the history of Puppet's DevOps Reports. The 2015 State of DevOps Report presents compelling evidence for the transformative power of DevOps in the IT industry. The report emphasizes that high-performing IT organizations consistently outperform their counterparts in terms of deployment frequency, lead time, failure rates, and recovery speed. These superior results are attributed to the adoption of practices, which streamline software delivery and enhance operational efficiency. A key highlight of the report is the symbiotic relationship between lean management and continuous delivery. By integrating these principles, organizations can cultivate a culture of continuous improvement, reduce burnout, and achieve remarkable IT performance. The report also underscores the significance of application architecture in developer productivity, advocating for designs that prioritize testability and deployability. Key findings of the report include: High-performing IT organizations deploy 30 times more frequently with 200 times shorter lead times, experience 60 times fewer failures, and recover 168 times faster than their lower-performing peers. Lean management and continuous delivery practices are instrumental in creating an environment that enables faster and sustainable value delivery. High performance is achievable regardless of whether applications are greenfield, brownfield, or legacy, as long as they are architected with testability and deployability in mind. IT managers play a crucial role in facilitating transformations by connecting strategic business objectives with on-the-ground execution. Diversity is a key factor in high-performing teams, with research indicating that teams with more women members exhibit higher collective intelligence and achieve superior business outcomes. Deployment pain is a significant indicator of IT performance, with organizations experiencing painful deployments often exhibiting poorer IT performance, organizational performance, and culture. Burnout can be effectively prevented through the implementation of practices that foster a supportive work environment, emphasize learning from failures, and promote a strong sense of purpose.
