  "content": "Prior to 2018, research was conducted in partnership with Puppet, as an extension of their original State of DevOps research. Read the history of Puppet's DevOps Reports. The 2014 State of DevOps Report provides compelling evidence that DevOps is not just a set of technical practices but a cultural shift that can drive significant improvements in IT and organizational performance. By adopting DevOps practices and fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement, organizations can achieve higher levels of productivity, profitability, and market share. Key findings of the report include: High-performing IT organizations were twice as likely to exceed their profitability, market share, and productivity goals. DevOps practices, such as version control and continuous delivery, are correlated with high IT performance. [Organizational culture](/capabilities/generative-organizational-culture/] is a strong predictor of IT and organizational performance, with high-trust cultures leading to better results. [Job satisfaction](/capabilities/job-satisfaction/] is the number one predictor of organizational performance and is highly correlated with DevOps practices and culture. Continuous integration and continuous delivery, along with automated testing and version control, are key practices that impact IT performance. The longer an organization practices DevOps, the more its IT performance improves. A virtuous circle exists between IT performance and organizational performance, where each positively influences the other. Download the 2014 State of DevOps Report",
