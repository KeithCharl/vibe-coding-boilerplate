# AI-Enhanced Prompt and Persona Generation

This document describes the new AI-powered features for creating prompts and personas in the knowledge base application.

## Overview

The application now includes AI assistance for both prompt and persona generation, allowing users to describe what they need and have AI help build it out automatically.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– AI Persona Generation

**Location**: `/t/[tenantId]/personas` â†’ Create Persona â†’ AI Assistant tab

**Capabilities**:
- Generate personas from natural language descriptions
- Specify expertise areas, tone, communication style, and constraints
- Refine generated personas with additional feedback
- Copy individual fields or use the complete generated persona

**Example Usage**:
```
Description: "I need a technical support specialist who can help users troubleshoot software issues"
Expertise: "Software troubleshooting, customer service"
Tone: "Patient and professional"
Style: "Step-by-step explanations"
Constraints: "Keep responses under 300 words"
```

### âœ¨ AI Prompt Generation

**Location**: `/t/[tenantId]/prompts` â†’ Create Prompt â†’ AI Assistant tab

**Capabilities**:
- Generate prompts from natural language descriptions
- Specify purpose, output format, tone, and constraints
- Automatically categorize and tag prompts
- Refine generated prompts iteratively
- Copy individual fields or create the complete prompt

**Example Usage**:
```
Description: "I need a prompt for writing professional email responses to customer complaints"
Purpose: "Customer service communication"
Format: "Professional email format"
Tone: "Empathetic and solution-focused"
Constraints: "Include acknowledgment, solution, and follow-up"
```

## User Interface

### Dual-Tab Interface

Both persona and prompt creation now feature a tabbed interface:

1. **Manual Creation**: Traditional form-based creation
2. **AI Assistant**: AI-powered generation with refinement capabilities

### AI Generation Workflow

1. **Describe**: Enter a natural language description of what you need
2. **Specify** (Optional): Add details like tone, format, constraints
3. **Generate**: AI creates a complete prompt/persona
4. **Review**: Examine the generated content with copy-to-clipboard functionality
5. **Refine** (Optional): Request improvements with natural language feedback
6. **Use**: Either copy to manual form or create directly

### Key UI Elements

- **Sparkles Icon**: Indicates AI-powered features
- **Copy Buttons**: One-click copying of generated content
- **Refinement Section**: Interactive improvement requests
- **Badge System**: Clear labeling of different content sections
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during AI processing

## Technical Implementation

### Server Actions

#### Personas
- `generatePersonaWithAI()`: Creates personas from descriptions
- `refinePersonaWithAI()`: Improves existing personas based on feedback

#### Prompts
- `generatePromptWithAI()`: Creates prompts from descriptions
- `refinePromptWithAI()`: Improves existing prompts based on feedback

### AI Integration

- **Model**: GPT-4o-mini for cost-effective generation
- **Temperature**: 0.7 for balanced creativity and consistency
- **Prompt Engineering**: Specialized system prompts for optimal results
- **JSON Response**: Structured outputs for reliable parsing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and user-friendly error messages

### Security & Permissions

- Respects existing tenant-based access controls
- Requires `contributor` role or higher for generation
- All generated content follows the same privacy and sharing rules

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Faster Creation**: Generate complete prompts/personas in seconds
- **Expert Guidance**: AI applies prompt engineering best practices
- **Iterative Improvement**: Refine outputs until they meet exact needs
- **Learning Tool**: See examples of well-structured prompts and personas

### For Organizations
- **Consistency**: AI ensures high-quality, well-structured content
- **Efficiency**: Reduces time spent on prompt/persona creation
- **Accessibility**: Makes expert prompt engineering available to all users
- **Innovation**: Encourages experimentation with different approaches

## Usage Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed descriptions for better results
2. **Use Examples**: Include examples of desired outputs in your description
3. **Iterate**: Use the refinement feature to perfect your content
4. **Review Carefully**: Always review AI-generated content before using
5. **Combine Approaches**: Start with AI, then manually fine-tune if needed

### Example Descriptions

**Good Persona Description**:
"Create a data analyst persona who specializes in e-commerce metrics. They should communicate insights clearly to non-technical stakeholders, focus on actionable recommendations, and always include supporting data in their responses."

**Good Prompt Description**:
"I need a prompt for analyzing customer feedback and extracting key themes. It should categorize feedback into positive, negative, and neutral sentiment, identify the main topics discussed, and suggest actionable improvements."

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"AI response missing required fields"**: The AI's response wasn't properly formatted. Try regenerating.
2. **"Failed to parse AI response"**: Network or parsing error. Try again.
3. **Generic outputs**: Provide more specific descriptions and requirements.

### Getting Better Results

- Add context about your specific use case
- Specify the intended audience for the prompt/persona
- Include any industry-specific requirements
- Mention any constraints or limitations

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Template-based generation for common use cases
- Integration with existing prompt/persona libraries
- Batch generation capabilities
- Advanced customization options
- Usage analytics and optimization suggestions
