# AI Agent Hub - Enterprise Multi-Agent Platform

## Overview
A fully functional enterprise-grade AI Agent Hub that provides a centralized platform for managing and orchestrating specialized AI agents. The system has been transformed from a UI mockup into a working platform with real agent implementations.

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Agent Registry**: Central management of agent definitions and metadata

- **API Endpoints**: RESTful APIs for agent execution and management
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time agent health tracking and metrics
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Message passing and coordination system
- **Task Execution**: Direct UI for running agent tasks with results display

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL
- **AI/LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini via LangChain
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with multi-tenant support
- **Real-time**: Client-side health monitoring with auto-refresh

## API Endpoints

### Agent Execution
- `POST /api/agents/[agentId]/execute` - Execute agent tasks
- `GET /api/agents/[agentId]/execute` - Get agent capabilities and status

### Health Monitoring
- `GET /api/agents/[agentId]/health` - Get agent health status
- `POST /api/agents/[agentId]/health` - Force health check

### Agent Management
- `GET /api/agents` - List all agents with optional enrichment
- `POST /api/agents` - Manage agent configurations (enable/disable/configure)

## Key Features

### Real Agent Execution
- Direct task execution through UI
- Real-time results and error handling
- Task history and result caching
- Operation-specific input forms

### Health Monitoring
- Real-time health status tracking
- Performance metrics (response time, uptime, success rate)
- Trend analysis and alerting
- Auto-refresh monitoring dashboard

### Multi-Tenant Support
- Tenant-specific agent configurations
- Role-based access control (admin/user/viewer)
- Per-tenant resource limits and security settings
- Isolated agent instances per tenant

### Enterprise Security
- Request validation and authorization
- Audit logging for all agent communications
- Encryption and compliance frameworks
- IP whitelisting and security events

### Inter-Agent Communication
- Message passing between agents
- Dependency management
- Communication logging and monitoring
- Error handling and retry logic

## Database Schema

### Agent System Tables
- `agent_registry` - Core agent definitions
- `tenant_agent_configs` - Per-tenant configurations  
- `agent_health_metrics` - Health monitoring data
- `agent_communication_log` - Inter-agent communication audit
- `agent_security_events` - Security event logging

## UI Components

### MultiAgentHub
- Agent grid with real-time health status
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Direct links to agent execution
- System overview sidebar

### AgentDashboard
- Individual agent management interface
- Real-time task execution tab
- Health monitoring and configuration
- Performance analytics

### AgentExecutor
- Interactive task execution interface
- Operation-specific input forms
- Real-time results display
- Task history and result caching

### AgentHealthMonitor
- Real-time health monitoring dashboard
- Auto-refresh health data
- Trend analysis and alerts
- Individual agent health cards

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Required for AI operations
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Authentication secret

### Agent Configuration
- Enable/disable per tenant
- Resource limits and quotas
- Security settings and compliance
- Custom configuration per agent type

## Project Rules & Patterns

### Brand Identity
- Primary color: bancon navy (#002C54)
- Accent colors: teal (#00B3B0), orange (#FF6B00)
- Fonts: Montserrat, Open Sans
- Responsive, enterprise-grade design

### Code Patterns
- Server Components for data fetching
- Client Components for interactivity
- Serializable data transfer between server/client
- Real agent implementations extending BaseAgent
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Development Workflow
- Use Context7 for up-to-date documentation
- Follow existing component patterns
- Prefer shadcn components over custom builds
- Real-time monitoring and health checks

## Deployment

### Build Process
1. Run `npm run build` to compile
2. Database migrations via Drizzle
3. Agent system initialization
4. Deploy with `vercel --prod`

### Production Considerations
- PostgreSQL with PGVector for embeddings
- Environment-specific configurations
- Health monitoring and alerting
- Backup and disaster recovery
