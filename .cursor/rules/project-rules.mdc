# Architecture
- Nextjs 15 with App Router
- Drizzle ORM for Database Schema
- Postgres Database
- Langchain & OpenAI for AI functionality
- NextAuth for Authentication (with Google Provider)
- Tailwind & ShadCN for styling
- Use Server Actions over Route Handlers (APIs)
- Use Vercel Blob storage with files
- 
# Project structure
src/
src/app/
src/server/db/ (for all database config and schema)
src/server/auth.ts (for auth config)
src/server/actions/ (for all server action logic)

# Important
When making schema changes, remind the user to run the following commands.
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate

If possible, run these commands yourself.

# Additional rules
- DO NOT install @radix-ui directly. Use shadcn components only.
- DO NOT use Toast for notifications! Use shadcn Sonner for notifications.
- The database connection var is called POSTGRES_URL, not DATABASE_URL.
- DO NOT create a middleware file.  Protect the backend logic within the routes and server actions.
- Use the existing AUTH config file (src/server/auth.ts). Do not create a new file.
